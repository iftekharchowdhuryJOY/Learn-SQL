##INNER JOIN

select sum(A.count) AS A from ENGINEER  AS A
inner join DATA d
on A.ID = d.ID  and d.Type = 'FrontEnd'

INNER JOIN - at least one match in both tables.

Columns Aliases - temporary column name
Do not forget to use on clause 

Here is example: 
SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;



SELECT 
    IF(ev.Rating < 6, NULL, e.Name) AS Names , 
     ev.Rating as Rating 
FROM 
    EMPLOYEE e
INNER JOIN 
    EVALUATION ev 
ON 
    e.Points BETWEEN ev.Lower AND ev.Upper
ORDER BY 
    Rating DESC, 
    e.Name ASC;

/* YOUR QUERY GOES HERE
   Example: SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE; 
*/
select  count(e.Name) AS `COUNT(Name)`
FROM 
    EMPLOYEE e
INNER JOIN 
    EVALUATION ev 
ON 
    e.Points BETWEEN ev.Lower AND ev.Upper
where ev.Rating <3;


select  count(e.Name) AS `COUNT(Name)`
FROM 
    EMPLOYEE e
INNER JOIN 
    EVALUATION ev 
ON 
    e.Points BETWEEN ev.Lower AND ev.Upper
where ev.Rating > 8;
